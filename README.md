I’m Steve, I’m an interface and website developer.

I work on primarly React and React Native Projects.

I live in the Northwest USA near Seattle.

My background is in building out dashboards, websites, and apps in Javascript using React, Nextjs, GraphQL, and Webflow.

I have a few Solidity projects on testnets that I have been working on as learning exercises. 

Astros is a PFP project that I am using to add all the polish and nice to haves (Wallet interaction, post mint display, rarity) of a new web3 project and to work on my characters (little astronauts) in Blender 3d and another with generated SVGs. Unless I can nail the art I don’t think I will publish but it is a good exercise.

Halloween Horror is a character driven horror fighting game. Loosely based off the move cabin in the woods. It includes stats, battles, items, and layered art upgrades. It is also currently deployed on Rinkeby with updates daily.
