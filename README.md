👋 I’m Steve, I’m an Frontend Engineer, developing web3 interfaces & websites.

🌲 I live in the Northwest USA near Seattle.

💻 My background is in building out dashboards, websites, and apps in Javascript using React, Nextjs, GraphQL, and Webflow.

⚔️ I am part of the [Solidity Guild](https://www.solidityguild.com/) a Collective of web3 crypto developers. (Built the website so if you see a typo let me know!)

🌱 Building [GAIA](https://github.com/gaia-dao/gaia-frontend) a reclamed land reserve currency. 

🙋 I built [Solana Jobs](http://solanajobs.xyz/) a job board build on Solana with all data stored on chain. Posting and paying in 1 transaction. Each job post is 1 sol a month.

😱 [Halloween Horror](https://halloweenhorror.xyz/) is a character driven horror fighting game. Loosely based off the move cabin in the woods. It includes stats, battles, items, and layered art upgrades. It is also currently deployed on Rinkeby with updates daily.

🧑‍🚀 [Astros](https://astros-nft.vercel.app/) is a PFP project that I am using to add all the polish and nice to haves (Wallet interaction, post mint display, rarity) of a new web3 project and to work on my characters (little astronauts) in Blender 3d and another with generated SVGs. Unless I can nail the art I don’t think I will publish but it is a good exercise.
